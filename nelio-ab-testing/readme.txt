= 12 Reasons for Choosing Nelio =

= #1 - ‚ù§Ô∏è Fully integrated within your WordPress =

There‚Äôs no [need to learn an external tool](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/5-reasons-use-nelio-ab-testing-wordpress/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing). Nelio A/B Testing has been designed to be simple and fast to use without ever leaving WordPress to create, edit or see the progress of your tests.

Our plugin lifts all the processing load from your own server and takes it back to our cloud. This way, A/B tests do not slow down your site or interfere with your hosting provider limits.


= #2 - ‚ú® Nelio AI =

Say goodbye to guesswork. With Nelio AI, you now have an intelligent assistant built right into your testing workflow:

* **Scan your entire site**, historical test data, WooCommerce sales stats, and even Google Analytics insights (if connected).
* **Get personalized test ideas**‚Äîeach with a clear hypothesis, recommended action, and rationale.
* **Instantly create a test template**‚Äîchoose from CSS, JS, PHP, WooCommerce, Page, or WordPress Patterns tests, among others.

Nelio AI helps you go from idea to execution faster and more confidently than ever.


= #3 - üôå Test everything! =

You can create all kinds of tests not only for pages but for all the elements of your WordPress:

* **All your content.** Improve your landing pages, write better posts, create alternative pages and custom post types, and start testing headlines.
* **WooCommerce Products.** Test the content of your WooCommerce store. Find out how to improve your products and offers to get more sales.
* **Global tests beyond content.** Try new themes, test different menus, templates or alternative widgets, modify your CSS rules, or create custom JavaScript snippets to change the appearance and behavior of your pages.
* **Heatmaps, Scrollmaps, and Confetti.** Find out what your visitors are doing from different devices as they browse your website. They are a perfect companion of A/B tests, for they give insights on what to test next and help you understand the progress of your tests.


= #4 - üñåÔ∏è Compatible with Gutenberg and The Best Page Builders =

Nelio A/B Testing not only works perfectly fine with the block editor but you can also create alternative content for your tests with your favorite page builder like Elementor, OptimizePress, SiteOrigin, Beaver Builder, Leadpages, Divi Builder, OptimizePress or Visual Composer.


= #5 - ü§ë Conversions are the key to success =

Nelio A/B Testing allows you to evaluate one or more [conversion goals](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/analytics/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing) and, for each of them, [track the important actions your visitors take](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/analytics/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing): visiting a page, clicking on an element, visiting an external link, submitting a form (compatible with Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Nelio Forms, Ninja Forms, WPForms , Formidable Forms, HubSpot Forms, Elementor forms, and more), watch YouTube videos, adding or purchasing WooCommerce products, or after you‚Äôve programmatically triggered your own custom JavaScript event.


= #6 - üìê Run tests targeted for specific set of visitors =

If you‚Äôre interested in testing a subset of your visitors, you can do so using [Nelio A/B Testing‚Äôs segmentation capabilities](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/help/how-to-use-segmentation-in-nelio-ab-testing/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing). Refine the audience you want to understand by defining the characteristics that are relevant for a specific test: country, language, device, referrer, date, time, and more!


= #7 - üìà Easy-to-understand results =

Visitors and test results are displayed immediately. All details are very intuitive and provide you with the information you need to know which alternative is working best for you:

* Day-to-day information that will help you understand what happens over time.
* See at a glance how confident you can be of having found a winning variant.
* Compare each variant with the original version.


= #8 - 1Ô∏è‚É£One-click winner =

Apply the winning version quickly and increase your income right away! Once you know which version is the best, make it your default page as soon as possible. You can do it with a simple click!


= #9 - üõ†Ô∏è Cache Support and Server Load =

One of our priorities is efficiency. The process of A/B testing a site is not necessarily at odds with performance. Nelio A/B Testing implements several mechanisms to reduce the impact of testing your site, such as [support for cache systems in WordPress](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/help/is-nelio-ab-testing-compatible-with-cache-plugins/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use an A/B Testing Solution specifically designed for WordPress? =

* **Smooth learning curve.** There is no need to learn yet another tool.
Everything (from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is done from the WordPress dashboard you are familiar with, resulting in a well-known, perfectly integrated user interface.
* **Evolve your WordPress site easily.** A native WordPress solution automates and simplifies the evolution of your site. Consider, for example, applying the winner alternative in your site as soon as the results are statistically significant. With a native solution, this is as easy as clicking one single button. With a generic tool, on the other hand, you would have to manually modify the page so that it integrates the changes you created in the (winning) alternative.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The ‚Äútesting unit‚Äù in a generic tool is the web page, since the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access to. A native WordPress solution, however, permits you to test any WordPress specific component, such as posts, pages, CSS, themes, child themes, and many more coming!
